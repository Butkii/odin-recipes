    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shortbread is a traditional Scottish biscuit that is made using sugar, butter and plain wheat flour.</p>
    <p>Unlike other baked goods, shortbread does not contain any leavening such as baking soda or baking powder. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ( 8oz/225g) ) butter (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (2oz/60g)) powdered sugar (sifted)</li>
        <li>2 cups (10oz/300g)) all purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl cream together the soft butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add in the flour and mix until the dough just comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a counter dusted with powdered sugar and gently roll the dough into a long two-by-two-inch log.</li>
        <li>Wrap the log of cookie dough in plastic wrap and allow it to firm up in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the dough is firm slice the cookies into 3/4 inch thick rounds. Place each round on your baking tray and bake for 16-18 minutes or until just golden.</li>
        <li>Allow cooling slightly before transferring to a cooling rack. Once cool the cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for up to 3 days.</li>
